#Task F

#Compare this value with the one obtained from the pivot table in (B). Which is a more 
#accurate estimate?

#0.9151253 in task E is very similar to task B 0.1096654. The different between the exact and naive bayes methods is #that the exact apporoach requires the same independent variable classification to predict, where as the navie bayes #method does not.

#Task G
