#a)Use only the numerical variables (1 to 9) to cluster the 21 firms. 
#Justify the various choices made in conducting the cluster analysis,
#such as weights for different variables, the specific clustering algorithm(s) used, the number of clusters
#formed, and so on.

#Prior to clustering data, remove the missing data and rescale variables for comparability.

#gives the data after removing the incomplete cases.

x <- na.omit(pharma12) 
x

#collect only the quantitative variables(1-9) to cluster the 21 firms
row.names(x)<- x[,1]
Pharma<- x[,3:11]

#Scale all the quantitative variables in the dataframe

#To determine the no of clusters to do the cluster analysis using Elbow Method

fviz_nbclust(Pharma1, kmeans, method = "wss") + labs(subtitle = "Elbow Method")

#The plot looks like an arm with clean elbow at k=2.We could either choose 2345 and the graph is not sharp and clean.

#Silhouette method for determining no of clusters

fviz_nbclust(Pharma1, kmeans, method = "silhouette")+ labs(subtitle = "Silhouette Method")

#From the above plots, it is clear that the no of clusters are 5 and they are enough to
#show the variations that are present in the data

set.seed(64060)
kmeans5<- kmeans(Pharma1,centers=5,nstart = 25)

#Visualizing the output

kmeans5$centers
fviz_cluster(kmeans5,data = Pharma1) 


# to Visualize the clusters
kmeans5
distance<- dist(Pharma1, method = "euclidean")
fviz_dist(distance)

#K-Means Cluster Analysis- Fit the data with 5 clusters

fit<-kmeans(Pharma1,5)


#Finding the mean value of all quantitative variables for each cluster

aggregate(Pharma1,by=list(fit$cluster),FUN=mean)

Pharma2<-data.frame(Pharma1,fit$cluster)
Pharma2
View(Pharma)

#To view the cluster plot

clusplot(Pharma1,fit$cluster,color = TRUE,shade = TRUE,labels = 2,lines = 0)

#b) Interpret the clusters with respect to the numerical variables used in forming the clusters. 

# Mean values of all quantitative variables for each clusters.

#cluster1_ JNJ,MRK,PFE,GSK

#cluster2_ AHM,WPI,AVE

#cluster3_ CHTT,IVX,MRX,ELN

#cluster4_ PHA,BAY,AGN 

#cluster5_ ABT,SGP,WYE,VMY,LLY,AZN,NVS


#For Cluster1 They have the highest market_Cap and has Good Leverage value.
#For Cluster2 They have lowest asset_turnover,and lowest beta.
#For Cluster3 They have the lowest market capitalization, Leverage and Beta are good. It has #highest revenue growth. #For Cluster4 These have the highest PE_Ratio. ROE value is not good.
#For Cluster5 They have lowest revenue growth, highest assets turnover and highest #net profit margin.


#c) Is there a pattern in the clusters with respect to the numerical variables (10 to 12)? (those not used in 
#forming the clusters) 

#There is a pattern in the clusters regarding the recommendation variable, which is also depicted in the graph.

#Clusters 1,2,4,5 has Hold Recommendation,Clusters 1,3 has mostly Moderate Buy Recommendation.

#For cluster 1: It has the highest market_Cap and has Good Leverage value. And they can be moderately recommended.
#For cluster 2: It has lowest asset_turnover,and lowest beta. But media recommendations are highly positive.
#For cluster 3: The leverage ratio is high, they are moderately recommended.
#For cluster 4: It  has the highest PE_Ratio and needs to be held as per the media recommendations.
#For Cluster 5: They have lowest revenue growth, highest assest turnover and highest net profit margin.


#d) Provide an appropriate name for each cluster using any or all of the variables in the dataset. 

#1 cluster- Moderate Buy (or) Hold cluster.
#2 cluster- Buy or sell cluster.  
#3 cluster- Buy Cluster - It has good stability. 
#4 cluster- Hold cluster -They have decent numbers.
#5 cluster- High Hold cluster.
