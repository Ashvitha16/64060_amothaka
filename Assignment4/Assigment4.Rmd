#a)Use only the numerical variables (1 to 9) to cluster the 21 firms. 
#Justify the various choices made in conducting the cluster analysis,
#such as weights for different variables, the specific clustering algorithm(s) used, the number of clusters
#formed, and so on.

#Prior to clustering data, remove the missing data and rescale variables for comparability.

#gives the data after removing the incomplete cases.

#To determine the no of clusters to do the cluster analysis using Elbow Method

fviz_nbclust(Pharma1, kmeans, method = "wss") + labs(subtitle = "Elbow Method")

#The plot looks like an arm with clean elbow at k=2.We could either choose 2345 and the graph is not sharp and clean.

#Silhouette method for determining no of clusters

fviz_nbclust(Pharma1, kmeans, method = "silhouette")+ labs(subtitle = "Silhouette Method")

#From the above plots, it is clear that the no of clusters are 5 and they are enough to
#show the variations that are present in the data

#Visualizing the output

# to Visualize the clusters

distance<- dist(Pharma1, method = "euclidean")

#K-Means Cluster Analysis- Fit the data with 5 clusters

#Finding the mean value of all quantitative variables for each cluster

#To view the cluster plot

#b) Interpret the clusters with respect to the numerical variables used in forming the clusters. 

# Mean values of all quantitative variables for each clusters.

#cluster1_ JNJ,MRK,PFE,GSK

#cluster2_ AHM,WPI,AVE

#cluster3_ CHTT,IVX,MRX,ELN

#cluster4_ PHA,BAY,AGN 

#cluster5_ ABT,SGP,WYE,VMY,LLY,AZN,NVS


#For Cluster1 has highest Market_cap,ROA,ROE,Asset_Turnover and lowest is Beta,PE_Ratio.
#For Cluster2 has highest Rev_Growth and lowest PE_Ratio, Asset_Turnover. 
#For Cluster3 has highest Beta, Leverage and lowest Market_Cap, ROE, ROA, Leverage, Rev_Growth, Net_Profit_Margin.
#For Cluster4 has highest PE_Ratio and lowest Leverage, Asset_Turnover.
#For Cluster5 has highest Net_Profit_Margin and lowest leverage,Beta.


#c) Is there a pattern in the clusters with respect to the numerical variables (10 to 12)? (those not used in 
#forming the clusters) 

#There is a pattern in the clusters regarding the recommendation variable, which is also depicted in the graph.

#Clusters 1,2,4,5 has Hold Recommendation,Clusters 1,3 has mostly Moderate Buy Recommendation.


#d) Provide an appropriate name for each cluster using any or all of the variables in the dataset. 

#1 cluster- Buy cluster or High beta.

#2 cluster- High Net_Profit_Margin cluster or High hold cluster.

#3 cluster- Hold cluster or Low PE_Ratio. 

#4 cluster-Moderate Buy cluster.

#5 cluster- High Buy cluster.
